# SpaceX Countdown
A SpaceX mission countdown clock [running 24/7](https://go.aws/36C1usc) always counting down to the next SpaceX mission. It pulls data from the [Reddit SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and automatically updates the countdown on load to the next mission launch time. The background is NASA Earth views originally sourced from [NASA.com](https://www.nasa.gov/content/ultra-high-definition-video-gallery) uploaded to [YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fYKMCCPh28). 

## TODO
* Make the video in the background loop. Right now it doesn't. It just runs for ≈1h30m
* Auto switch the feed over to the live feed when one hour out.
* If there's no time for launch, display a message like "LAUNCH NOT SCHEDULED" or something like that.
* Change resolution if mobile user or low-end videocard because playback stutters on devices like Raspberry Pi

## This project was made with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
